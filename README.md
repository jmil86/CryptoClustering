# CryptoClustering
## Overview
This project uses machine learning to analyze and group cryptocurrencies based on their performance and characteristics. By clustering similar cryptocurrencies, we can better understand market trends and identify potential investment opportunities.

## Code Summary
The code in `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` performs the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loads cryptocurrency data from crypto_market_data.csv, cleans it, and prepares it for analysis.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's complexity while retaining important information.
3. **Clustering**: Applies the K-Means algorithm to group cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their similarities.
4. **Visualization**: Creates scatter plots and Elbow graphs to display the clustering results.

## Results
The analysis successfully grouped cryptocurrencies into distinct clusters. These clusters highlight patterns in the market, such as which cryptocurrencies have similar performance or characteristics. The visualizations make it easier to interpret these groupings and provide insights for further exploration.
